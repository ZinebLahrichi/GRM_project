# GRM_project

Graphical Models Project based on the paper : *Claudia Nieuwenhuis and Daniel Cremers. Spatially Varying Color Distributions for Interactive Multi-Label Segmentation*

The implementation of the optimisation algorithm was cloned from https://github.com/GregoireBoussac/SpaceAndColorSegmentation
We adapted the code to run it on a new dataset and try new experiments on texture and video tracking.
